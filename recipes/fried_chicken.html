        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="description">
            <p>I am going to call it (obnoxious as it is), this fried chicken is 
                better than KFC. There is not a trace of soggy skin anywhere 
                (all you closet KFC lovers know exactly what I am talking about!) 
                and the crust is thicker and craggier. </p>
    
            <p>Every inch of this crust is insanely crunchy, and there is loads 
                of those nubbly bits that get extra crunchy. The seasoning is 
                satisfyingly spot on, strong but not outrageously overpowering. 
                The buttermilk marinated flesh is tender and juicy all the way 
                through, and the deep golden colour is sheer perfection. </p>
                
            <p>Seriously, what kind of human being could resist a piping hot pile 
                of freshly made fried chicken??</p>
