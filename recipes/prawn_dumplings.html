                <li>1/4 cup bamboo shoots (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>1 cup wheat starch</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cornstarch (or tapioca starch)</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups boiling water (add an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons in dryer climates)</li>

        </div>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <div class="recipe">
            <ol>
                <li>Mix everything (except the bamboo) together; 
                    whip in one direction for a few minutes until the mixture starts to look sticky. 
                    Now add the chopped bamboo shoots, and mix everything together. 
                    Cover and refrigerate while preparing the dough.</li>
                <li>Mix the wheat starch and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Slowly add in the boiling water, 
                    while stirring rapidly. Now add in the lard (or oil) and continue to stir. 
                    Knead the dough for a couple of minutes, until it turns into a smooth dough ball. 
                    Roll the dough into a long cylinder, and divide it into 18 equal pieces. 
                    Cover the dough pieces with a damp paper towel.</li>
                <li>Turn on the stove to pre-boil the water in the steamer. 
                    Take one piece of dough and roll it into a 3‚Äù diameter circle. 
                    Add a spoonful of filling and fold the dumpling as shown in our video. 
                    Continue assembling until all the dumplings are made.</li>
                <li>Once the water in the steamer is boiled, 
                    steam the shrimp dumplings for 6 minutes using high heat and serve hot. 
                    Make sure that they each have an inch and a half to expand during the cooking process.</li>
